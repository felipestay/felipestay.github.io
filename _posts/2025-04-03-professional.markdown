## Professional Activities

Since October 2019, I have been the Executive Director at [Moviliza](https://movilizachile.org) in Santiago, Chile. As one of the founders and the current head of the organisation, I oversee the execution and evaluation of programs, as well as the procurement and management of resources. I am also responsible for advocating for social policies and coordinating networks of collaboration between civil society and the public sector. My role requires strategic thinking, resource management, and the ability to navigate complex policy landscapes to ensure the successful implementation and impact of our social programs. Working at Moviliza has offered me the opportunity to leverage my skills in strategic planning, team management, and policy design, while deepening my understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities in the social sector. This role has enabled me to make a meaningful contribution to our mission of driving social change, and I look forward to continuing to lead our efforts in the years to come.

From November 2010 to October 2018, I worked as an independent consultant in Santiago, Chile, specialising in social protection policies for families and children. I collaborated with various clients, including the Inter-American Development Bank, the Ministry of Social Development, the Local Government of the Ministry of the Interior, the Childhood Council, and the Popular Housing Service. My role involved designing, implementing, and evaluating social policies, conducting impact assessments, carrying out comparative policy studies, creating intervention strategies, and designing information systems for social initiatives. During this time, I also served as a Social Policy Consultant at Bp Consultancy from November 2015 to October 2018 and as a consultant at the Ministry of Social Development (MDS) from February to November 2015, managing intersectoral collaboration for the National Care System's design.

Between January 2008 and October 2010, I held the position of Programme Manager and Methodological Advisor at the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) in Santiago, Chile. My primary duties involved creating and facilitating social policies under the "Security and Opportunities" initiative, with a particular focus on programs for homeless individuals and children with incarcerated parents. I collaborated closely with various internal departments, such as FOSIS, the Puente Program, SENDA, and SENADIS. My role encompassed everything from policy conceptualization to implementation, aiming to launch social programs that significantly improved the lives of community members.
