I am a sociologist pursuing a PhD in sociology at UC Chile. I hold a Master’s degree in Social Policy from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a degree in Sociology from the University of Bristol. My research focuses on system justification, perceptions of inequality, exclusion pathways, homelessness, and the design of social policies. Through my work, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of these complex social issues and inform the development of more effective and inclusive social policies.
