### Conferences

I have participated in various conferences to present my research and findings:

- **DEMOSAL in Argentina - 2023**: Presented a systematic review about information interventions related to inequality.
- **CISAL in Mexico - 2023**: Presented on the topic of death among homeless people in Santiago.
