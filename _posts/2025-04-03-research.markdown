1. Doctoral Dissertation (Results expected in 2025): As part of my PhD, I am conducting a series of studies, including a scoping review on information-based interventions to shift political and policy preferences; an observational study examining the relationship between material deprivation and economic system justification; and an experiment testing how exposure to information about inequality, poverty, and systemic crises influences people’s motivation to justify the economic system. All results will be finalised by the end of this year.
2. Housing First Fidelity Study in Chile (2025): I am leading a mixed-methods evaluation of the fidelity of Housing First interventions in Chile, drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data collected from practitioners and social workers. This study is also scheduled for completion in 2025.
3. Scoping Review and Comparative Case Study on Unsheltered Youth in Latin America (2026): In partnership with the IDRC, I am conducting a scoping review and comparative case study on the health and well-being of unsheltered youth, as well as the public policies aimed at addressing these challenges. The study focuses on seven countries: Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico. The project is expected to conclude in 2026.
