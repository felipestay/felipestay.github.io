My doctoral research delves into the complexities of system justification and the perception of inequality. I have conducted a systematic review of experiments that manipulate information about inequality and investigated the relationship between deprivation and economic system justification. In my upcoming experiment, I will manipulate information about inequality to examine its impact on system justification.

Additionally, I focus on homelessness and social policy. I am conducting a fidelity analysis and a survival analysis of the Housing First approach, aiming to evaluate its effectiveness in addressing homelessness and informing better social policies.
